# üéØ Codeforces Solutions in Python

> **Why Python?** While most competitive programmers use C++ for its speed, I've chosen Python to prove that elegant, readable code can be just as competitive. Every solution here demonstrates that algorithmic thinking matters more than language choice.

## üí° Why Python for Competitive Programming?

Most competitive programmers choose C++ for its blazing speed, but I've taken a different path:

- **üß† Readability First:** Clean, maintainable code that's easy to understand and debug
- **‚ö° Smart Optimization:** Proving that algorithmic efficiency beats language speed
- **üéØ Focus on Logic:** Less time wrestling with syntax, more time solving problems
- **üêç Python Power:** Built-in data structures, elegant syntax, rapid prototyping

**The Challenge:** Making Python competitive where others say it's too slow. Spoiler: It works!
